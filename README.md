# DC motor with quadrature encoder

Really, this project is just me starting an experiement using Rust and RTFM. I've done
something like this in C++ both in Chibios and MBed, so I can compare the experience.

This is mostly following instructions in [RTFM by example, Starting a new project][rtfm-by-example-new], and the [the embedded Rust book][book]
